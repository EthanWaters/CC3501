This repository is dedicated to the task of replicating human movements using the Niyro Ned Robot. The project's approach encompasses two primary solutions. Initially, a basic method using image thresholding was employed to capture and reproduce human movement. Subsequently, a more sophisticated solution was developed, incorporating sensors within an embedded system. This system effectively interfaces with a PC through a Python script, establishing a reliable communication channel with NED to achieve the desired mimicry of human motion.

The primary project code and scripts are located in the "Arm" folder. Additionally, this repository contains valuable resources in separate folders: "Documentation" provides comprehensive project documentation, "Client_Test_scripts" holds test scripts for client applications, "Embedded Examples" includes code examples for embedded systems, and "Niyro_examples" offers examples for working with Niyro robots.
